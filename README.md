Coding agents make small classification decisions all day: which of these 40 CI failures are
real, which files answer this question, does this PR do what its description says, how severe is
each finding. They usually do it by eyeballing, by writing a regex, or by burning a frontier-model
call per item.

[Jev](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/community/jev) is a decision model rather than a text model: you send evidence and typed
questions, it returns typed answers with calibrated probabilities, never prose. **jev-code** turns
that into a first-class tool for four coding agents and ships a skill that teaches the agent when
to reach for it.

## What you get

| Piece | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Five tools** | `jev_classify`, `jev_check`, `jev_score`, `jev_rank`, `jev_ask`. Same names, same JSON, in every harness. |
| **One skill** | [`skills/jev/SKILL.md`](skills/jev/SKILL.md) tells the agent when a task needs a classifier, how to write good classes and questions, and how to act on the answers. A reference adapted from TypeSafe's official skill covers building Jev into the user's own code. Follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) spec. |
| **One-command setup** | `jev-code setup` detects Claude Code, Codex, Pi, and OpenCode on your machine and wires both the skill and the tool into each. |
| **A CLI** | The same tools from bash, so the skill still works in a harness with no tool registered. |

## Quick start

**1. Get a key** at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) and export it:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

**2. Install into your agents** (Node.js 20+):

```bash
npx -y @goldjunge91/jev-code setup
```

That detects the harnesses on your machine and, for each one, copies the skill and registers the
Jev tool. Add harness names to be explicit (`setup claude codex pi opencode`), `--project` to
install into the current repository instead of your user profile, or `--dry-run` to see the plan
first.

**3. Check it works:**

```bash
npx -y @goldjunge91/jev-code doctor --live
```

**4. Restart your agent** (or `/reload` inside pi) and ask for something that needs a classifier:

> Triage the failing tests in the last CI run: which are flaky, which are real bugs?

The agent loads the `jev` skill, calls `jev_classify` with the failures and a class set, acts on
the `auto` results, and tells you which ones it double-checked by hand.

## What a call looks like

The agent sends raw evidence and its own classes:

```json
{
  "instructions": "Classify each test failure by its most likely root cause.",
  "items": [
    { "id": "test_login_sso", "text": "TimeoutError: SSO callback not received within 10s (attempt 3/3)" },
    { "id": "test_price_rounding", "text": "AssertionError: expected 19.99, got 19.989999999" }
  ],
  "classes": {
    "infrastructure": "Network, database, or runner problems unrelated to the code; likely passes on re-run",
    "assertion_bug": "The code produced a wrong value; deterministic and reproducible",
    "other": "Cannot tell from the excerpt"
  }
}
```

and gets back a label, the full distribution, and a decision it can branch on:

```json
{
  "summary": { "items": 2, "auto": 2, "review": 0, "by_label": { "infrastructure": 1, "assertion_bug": 1 } },
  "results": [
    { "id": "test_login_sso", "label": "infrastructure", "probability": 0.93, "margin": 0.88, "confidence": 0.9, "decision": "auto", "probabilities": { "infrastructure": 0.93, "assertion_bug": 0.05, "other": 0.02 } },
    { "id": "test_price_rounding", "label": "assertion_bug", "probability": 0.97, "margin": 0.95, "confidence": 0.95, "decision": "auto", "probabilities": { "infrastructure": 0.01, "assertion_bug": 0.97, "other": 0.02 } }
  ],
  "thresholds": { "auto_accept": 0.85, "min_margin": 0.5 },
  "model": "typesafe/jev-1.13",
  "usage": { "input_tokens": 310, "output_tokens": 18 }
}
```

More payloads in [`examples/`](examples) and the full contract in
[`skills/jev/references/tools.md`](skills/jev/references/tools.md).

## The tools

| Tool | Ask it when | Comes back with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jev_classify` | Many items, one label each from your classes | label, probabilities, margin, `decision: auto \| review` |
| `jev_check` | Yes/no questions about one piece of evidence | probability, `verdict: yes \| no \| uncertain` |
| `jev_score` | Many items on one ordered scale (severity, priority) | score, nearest level, confidence, decision |
| `jev_rank` | Which candidates answer a question | relevance per candidate, sorted, plus `any_relevant` |
| `jev_ask` | Anything else: mixed question types over one state | the raw System One answers |

Every tool validates its input locally (shapes, duplicate ids, request size) before spending a
call, batches every item into one request, and returns decisions computed from thresholds you can
override per call. Policy stays in your hands; Jev supplies the probabilities.

## Per-harness details

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

`jev-code setup claude` copies the skill to `~/.claude/skills/jev/` and runs
`claude mcp add --scope user jev -- npx -y @goldjunge91/jev-code mcp`. The tools appear as
`mcp__jev__jev_classify` and friends; the skill is `/jev`.

Prefer a plugin that updates itself? This repository is also a Claude Code plugin marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add goldjunge91/jev-code
claude plugin install jev-code@jev-code
```

The plugin bundles the skill (`/jev-code:jev`) and the MCP server. Manual configuration and
project-scope notes: [docs/harnesses/claude-code.md](docs/harnesses/claude-code.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex</strong></summary>

`jev-code setup codex` copies the skill to `~/.agents/skills/jev/` (Codex's user-level skills
directory, shared with Pi and OpenCode) and runs `codex mcp add jev -- npx -y @goldjunge91/jev-code mcp`.
Without the `codex` binary it appends a `[mcp_servers.jev]` table to `~/.codex/config.toml`
instead. Invoke the skill with `$jev`. Details: [docs/harnesses/codex.md](docs/harnesses/codex.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Pi</strong></summary>

Pi has no MCP client, so jev-code is also a [pi package](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/packages) whose
extension registers the five tools natively. `jev-code setup pi` runs
`pi install npm:@goldjunge91/jev-code` and copies the skill to `~/.agents/skills/jev/`. Run
`/reload` inside pi afterwards. Details: [docs/harnesses/pi.md](docs/harnesses/pi.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenCode</strong></summary>

`jev-code setup opencode` adds a local MCP entry to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (backing the
file up first) and copies the skill to `~/.agents/skills/jev/`, which OpenCode reads. A native
custom-tool variant lives in [`integrations/opencode/jev.ts`](integrations/opencode/jev.ts).
Details: [docs/harnesses/opencode.md](docs/harnesses/opencode.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Skill only, any agent</strong></summary>

The skill is a standard Agent Skills directory, so the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) installer
works for the 70+ agents it supports:

```bash
npx skills add goldjunge91/jev-code --skill jev
```

Pair it with the MCP server (`npx -y @goldjunge91/jev-code mcp`) in your agent's MCP config,
or let the agent fall back to the CLI.

</details>

## CLI

```bash
jev-code setup [claude|codex|pi|opencode ...] [--project] [--dry-run] [--no-env]
jev-code doctor [--live]
jev-code classify --input payload.json      # same JSON as the tool
echo '{"state":"12 passed, 0 failed","checks":{"green":"Did every test pass?"}}' | jev-code check
jev-code rank --input candidates.json --pretty
jev-code mcp                                 # what the harness configs launch
jev-code skill                               # path of the bundled skill
```

Output is JSON on stdout. Exit code 2 means a usage or configuration problem, 1 an API failure.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | required | Your OpenRouter key. |
| model | `typesafe/jev-1.13` | Fixed Jev model on OpenRouter. |
| `JEV_CODE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Per-attempt timeout. |
| `JEV_CODE_MAX_RETRIES` | `2` | Retries on 429, 5xx, timeouts, and connection errors. |

Jev runs through OpenRouter's System One endpoint. The endpoint and model are fixed.

## Security notes

- Only the payload you pass reaches Jev on OpenRouter: the items, the questions, and the optional
  context. Nothing is read from your repository or session on its own.
- Some harnesses filter the shell environment before launching MCP servers. `setup` therefore
  copies `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` into the harness's own server configuration when the variable is set.
  Pass `--no-env` to skip that and rely on the runtime environment instead.
- Config files that already exist are backed up next to the original (`*.bak-<timestamp>`)
  before they are modified. Malformed JSON or TOML is left untouched and reported.
- `doctor` prints a masked key hint only; the key itself is never logged.

## How it works

`src/tools/` holds the single definition of each tool: a zod schema, a description, and a `run`
function that builds one System One request and maps the answers to decisions. The MCP server
(`src/mcp/`), the Pi extension (`integrations/pi/`), the OpenCode custom tool
(`integrations/opencode/`), and the CLI (`src/cli/`) are thin adapters over that layer, which is
why the payloads and results are identical everywhere. `src/setup/` knows where each harness reads
skills and MCP configuration and prefers each harness's own CLI over editing files.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goldjunge91/jev-code && cd jev-code
npm install
npm run check          # lint, typecheck, skill validation, tests with coverage, build, smoke
npm test               # unit tests, no API key needed
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... npm run test:e2e # a few live calls against the real API
```

Try your local build against a real harness without publishing:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/cli.js setup claude --command "node $PWD/dist/cli.js mcp"
node dist/cli.js setup pi --pi-source "$PWD"
```
